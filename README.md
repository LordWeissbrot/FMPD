# FMPD Project
This is a simple GitHub Repo to document the progress of **Group 4** of the FMPD Project 2023 at TU Berlin.

## Basic goal of the Project
Given a selected flight consisting of...<br>
  ... a take-off and climb segment<br>
  ... a cruise segment<br>
  ... an arrival segment<br>
  ...and a landing segment<br>

Given input performance parameters such as...<br>
  ... Weight, fuel, cost index, wind, cruising altitude, max throttle settings<br>
 
Compute the lateral and vertical flight profile of a flight taking into account...<br>
  ... Fly-by or fly-over way point<br>
  ... Great-circle paths for cruise segments<br>
